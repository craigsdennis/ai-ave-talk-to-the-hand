# Update Background — Session Log (2025-09-05)

## What you asked for
- Use `public/talk-to-the-hand.jpg` as the website background image.
- Create a `truth-window` folder and keep markdown logs of what we build, showing what you asked for and what I did. Make one for this session.

## What I did
- Reviewed the project structure and opened `public/index.html`.
- Added a `<style>` block in `public/index.html:6` to set the page background:
  - Applied `background: url('talk-to-the-hand.jpg') no-repeat center center fixed;`
  - Used `background-size: cover` for full-viewport coverage.
  - Set `margin: 0` on `body` and added light text contrast (white + subtle shadow).
- Created this log at `truth-window/2025-09-05.md` to document the session.

## File changes
- Modified: `public/index.html`
- Added: `truth-window/2025-09-05.md`

## Notes / Next options
- I can add an overlay (e.g., semi-transparent dark layer) for improved text readability.
- I can keep or remove the current text styling depending on your preference.

## Follow-up request
- Add a sticky footer with two lines and links:
  - “Built with 🧡 using Cloudflare Workers && ElevenLabs Conversational Agent”
  - “👀 the code” (link to GitHub repo)
- Center the footer text.

## What I did (footer)
- Converted layout to flex on `body` with `min-height: 100vh` and wrapped main content in `<main>` so the footer anchors at the bottom.
- Added a translucent, blurred `footer` with two lines and links:
  - Cloudflare Workers → https://developers.cloudflare.com
  - ElevenLabs Conversational Agent → https://elevenlabs.io
- Centered the footer text via `text-align: center;`.
- Left “👀 the code” link as a placeholder (`#`) pending the GitHub URL.

## File changes (footer)
- Modified: `public/index.html`
